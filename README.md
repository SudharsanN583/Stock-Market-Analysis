# Stock Market Prediction

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for predicting stock market trends using machine learning algorithms. The goal is to analyze historical stock data and make predictions for future price movements.

## Features

- *Data Collection:* Gathered historical stock data from Apple stock data from kaggle
- *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):* Analyzed key metrics and patterns in the data.
- *Feature Engineering:* Created relevant features for model training.
- *Machine Learning Models:* Implemented and trained machine learning models for stock prediction.
- *Evaluation:* Assessed model performance using Accuracy score , prediction value , MSE
- *Visualization:* Visualized predictions and trends.

## Project Structure

- **data/:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **notebooks/:** Jupyter notebooks for EDA and model development.
- **src/:** Source code for the machine learning models.
- **results/:** Visualizations and model evaluation results.
